Error Handling and Edge Cases:

If the username is not provided in the POST /users/group or POST /messages/send requests, the API will respond with a message.

If a message is not provided in POST /messages, the API will respond with a message.

If the username does not exist when attempting to send a message, the API will return a message suggesting to create the user first.

If both username and groupname1 are provided in the request, the endpoint should return an message indicating that only one of these should be specified.

If groupname2 is missing, the endpoint should return an message indicating that groupname2 is mandatory.

If the user is already in group_name2, it returns an error message to avoid unnecessary database operations.

If the user is not in any group, an error is returned saying that the user isnâ€™t in a group and cannot be moved.

**For Testing you can use the above curl commands in cmd  or Do install {composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit} and run vendor/bin/phpunit**
